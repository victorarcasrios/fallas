## lasfallasmasmolestas (speed programming laravel application example)

At Valencia City, we have a festival called Las Fallas, you can see it at Wikipedia.

In those days, the "falleros" get drunk, throw firecrackers, eat, shout, sing loudly, get drunk again... while(true)

In my street theres a Casal (the falleros associate themself in "casales") and all the years they hire a discomobil and play music as loud as they can while get drunk again. From 12:00 to 4:00 of the night, two days in a week.

I can't sleep with a subwoofer in my head and glass trembling in my windows, so one night this year (2015) I decide to do this project all the quick I can with barely a month of experience in Laravel5.
And here it is.

I began it the first sleeplessness night (4.5 hours) and ended it and did the first commit the second infernal night.
I'm sleepy
